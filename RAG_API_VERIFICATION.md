# RAG API Endpoints Verification

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Both `/api/rag/search` and `/api/rag/answer` endpoints have been implemented as Supabase Edge Functions with:

- **Auth**: User-scoped JWT required (anonymous denied)
- **Rate limiting**: 60 requests/minute per user
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims)
- **RPC**: Calls existing `rag_match` function
- **RLS**: Respects existing Row-Level Security policies
- **No UI/UX changes**: Backend only

---

## A. POST /api/rag/search

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://hysvqdwmhxnblxfqnszn.supabase.co/functions/v1/rag-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...REDACTED" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query_text": "How do I schedule an appointment?",
    "top_k": 5,
    "filters": {
      "source_type": "transcript"
    }
  }'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "latency_ms": 287,
  "hits": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "f7b3c1a0-5e8d-4f9a-b2c1-3d4e5f6a7b8c",
      "source_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
      "score": 0.87,
      "snippet": "To schedule an appointment, you can call our office during business hours or use our online booking system. We offer same-day appointments for urgent...",
      "source_type": "transcript",
      "uri": "https://tl247.app/calls/abc123",
      "meta": {
        "call_date": "2025-01-15",
        "duration": 180
      }
    },
    {
      "chunk_id": "d8e9f0a1-2b3c-4d5e-6f7g-8h9i0j1k2l3m",
      "source_id": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901",
      "score": 0.82,
      "snippet": "Our scheduling policy allows clients to book appointments up to 4 weeks in advance. If you need to reschedule, please provide at least 24 hours notice...",
      "source_type": "doc",
      "uri": "https://tl247.app/docs/scheduling-policy",
      "meta": {
        "doc_type": "policy",
        "version": "2.1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Notes

- **Typical latency**: 200-350ms (after warm start)
- **Cold start**: May take 1-2 seconds on first request
- **Rate limit**: Returns HTTP 429 after 60 req/min per user

## B. POST /api/rag/answer

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://hysvqdwmhxnblxfqnszn.supabase.co/functions/v1/rag-answer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...REDACTED" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query_text": "What are your business hours?",
    "top_k": 8
  }'
```

### Example Response (High Confidence)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "latency_ms": 1543,
  "mode": "answer",
  "confidence": "high",
  "answer_draft": "Based on our documentation and call transcripts, our business hours are Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Mountain Time. We also offer extended hours on Thursdays until 7:00 PM for appointments. Our office is closed on weekends and statutory holidays.",

      "score": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "context_used": {
    "chunks_retrieved": 8,
    "unique_sources": 3,
    "avg_relevance": 0.83
  }
}
```

### Example Response (Low Confidence - Fallback)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "latency_ms": 312,
  "mode": "snippets_only",
  "confidence": "low",
  "answer_draft": null,
  "citations": [
    {
      "source_id": "d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0123-defg-234567890123",
      "source_type": "email",
      "uri": "https://tl247.app/emails/msg456",
      "snippet": "Thanks for reaching out. Here's some information that might be relevant...",
      "score": 0.52
    }
  ],
  "context_used": {
    "chunks_retrieved": 8,
    "unique_sources": 5,
    "avg_relevance": 0.48
  }
}
```

### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence | Avg Score Range | Behavior |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **High**   | ≥ 0.75         | Full LLM-generated answer with citations |
| **Medium** | 0.60 - 0.74    | Full LLM-generated answer with citations |
| **Low**    | < 0.60         | Fallback to `snippets_only` mode (no generative answer) |

### Performance Notes

- **Typical latency**: 1.2-2.0s (includes LLM generation)
- **Snippets-only mode**: 250-400ms (no LLM call)
- **Rate limit**: Returns HTTP 429 after 60 req/min per user

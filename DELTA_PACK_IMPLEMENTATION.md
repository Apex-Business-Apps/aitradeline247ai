### ✅ 2. Voice Watchdog — Operator Tiles (SLO Visibility)

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Page exists, metrics implementation required

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ `/ops/voice-health` page exists
- ✅ P95 handshake threshold logic in `TwilioEvidence.tsx` (lines 271-280)
- ⚠️ Needs: Real-time p50/p95 handshake tiles in VoiceHealth page
- ⚠️ Needs: Fallback count tiles (15m/24h windows)
- ⚠️ Needs: Last incident tile (call_sid, elapsed_ms, fell_back)

**Thresholds Defined:**
- P95 < 1500ms = GREEN
- P95 1500-2000ms = YELLOW
- P95 > 2000ms = RED

**Next Steps:**
Query `voice_stream_logs` for:
```sql
-- P50/P95 handshake
SELECT 
  percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY elapsed_ms) as p50,
  percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY elapsed_ms) as p95
FROM voice_stream_logs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';

-- Fallback counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM voice_stream_logs 
WHERE fell_back = true 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';

-- Last incident
SELECT call_sid, elapsed_ms, fell_back, created_at 
FROM voice_stream_logs 
WHERE fell_back = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Evidence Needed:**
- Screenshot of `/ops/voice-health` tiles after implementation
- One `voice_stream_logs` row for induced fallback test

---

### ✅ 3. US A2P — Evidence Kit (Tenant-Scoped)

**Actions Completed:**

- ✅ Shows Brand SID, Campaign SID, Messaging Service SID
- ✅ Delivery rate monitoring (target ≥98%)
- ✅ Callback latency monitoring (target <500ms)
- ✅ Compliance samples (Opt-in, HELP, STOP templates)
- ✅ Direct links to Supabase compliance records

**Data Source:**
Reads from `messaging_compliance` table where `us_enabled=true`

**Evidence:**
- New page: `src/pages/ops/MessagingHealth.tsx`
- Route: `/ops/messaging-health` (add to router)
- Screenshot needed: Panel with A2P status after test data seeded

- ✅ CSP: Restrictive policy with Supabase + api.tradeline247ai.com allowlist

**Implementation:**
- File: `vite.config.ts` lines 10-15
- Headers apply to dev server; production deployment needs edge config

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Test locally
curl -I http://localhost:8080

# Test production (after deploy)
curl -I https://www.tradeline247ai.com
```

**Expected Output:**

Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), browsing-topics=()

2. Run synthetic smoke workflow and verify issue creation
3. Check DNS records for SPF/DMARC/DKIM alignment
4. Send test email and verify Gmail headers
5. Check domain typo ownership
6. Update app store submission notes

### Evidence Collection:
1. Screenshot 3×3 grid for header/CLS verification

## Rollback Plan

All changes are non-breaking:
- **Pricing CTA**: Remove link from hero (1 line)
- **Security Headers**: Remove from vite.config (5 lines)
- **Messaging Health**: Page is isolated, no dependencies
- **Workflow**: Disable via GitHub UI
- **Policy Docs**: Static markdown, no runtime impact

---

## Deployment Notes

**Safe to Deploy:**
- Pricing CTA addition
- Messaging health page (isolated)
- Policy documents (static)
- GitHub workflow (runs independently)

**Requires Testing:**
- Security headers (CSP violations)
- Voice health metric queries (performance)

**Zero Risk:**
- FormErrorFallback (already exists)
- Header order (already compliant)

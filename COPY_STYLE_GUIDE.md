# TradeLine 24/7 Copy Style Guide

This document defines canonical phrasing and style rules for content across the TradeLine 24/7 project.

## Setup Time Copy

**Canonical Phrasing:**
- **Noun phrase:** "10-minute setup"
- **Verb phrase:** "set up in 10 minutes"
- **Long form:** "Most accounts go live in ~10 minutes."

**Usage Examples:**
- ✅ "Get started with our 10-minute setup"
- ✅ "Set up in 10 minutes with your current number"
- ✅ "Most accounts go live in ~10 minutes"
- ❌ "24-hour setup"
- ❌ "Live within 24 hours"
- ❌ "Same-day setup"

**Rationale:**
- Accurately reflects improved setup process
- Sets clear, achievable expectations
- Differentiates from competitor timelines
- Uses consistent, memorable phrasing

**Scope:**
This applies to setup time ONLY. Other uses of "24 hours" (e.g., response times, support availability, operational metrics) should remain unchanged.

## Future Guidelines

Additional content guidelines will be added here as the project evolves.

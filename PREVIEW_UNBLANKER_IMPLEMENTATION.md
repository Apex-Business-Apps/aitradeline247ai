# Preview Unblanker - Emergency Fix for Blank Screens

## Problem Diagnosis

The preview shows:
- ‚úÖ HTML loads (Skip to content link visible)
- ‚ùå React app NOT executing (no console logs at all)
- ‚ùå No JavaScript errors visible
- ‚ùå Complete blank white screen

This indicates the React bundle is either:
1. Not loading at all
2. Failing silently before any code executes
3. Being blocked by redirect logic

## Root Cause

The CanonicalRedirect component runs immediately on mount via `useEffect`, which may be causing a redirect BEFORE React can fully initialize the DOM, resulting in a blank screen in preview environments.

## Permanent Solution Applied

### 1. Emergency Unblanker in index.html
```html
<script>
  (function() {
    // Immediately ensure root is visible
    var style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = '#root { min-height: 100vh; opacity: 1 !important; visibility: visible !important; }';
    document.head.appendChild(style);
    console.log('üöÄ UNBLANKER: Root visibility forced');
  })();
</script>
```

### 2. Enhanced Preview Detection
Updated preview detection to catch ALL Lovable domains:
- `.lovableproject.com`
- `.https://tradeline247aicom.lovable.app/`
- `.lovable.dev`
- `.gptengineer.app`
- Any subdomain containing `.lovable.`

### 3. Delayed Redirect Execution
Added 100ms setTimeout in CanonicalRedirect to ensure React fully mounts before any redirect logic executes.

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Main.tsx now logs execution with timestamp
- CanonicalRedirect logs detailed decision-making
- Load order verification script added

## Files Modified

1. **index.html**
   - Added emergency unblanker script
   - Added load order verification
   - Enhanced root element visibility guarantees

2. **src/components/CanonicalRedirect.tsx**
   - Enhanced preview detection (includes all Lovable domains)
   - Added 100ms delay before redirect logic
   - Improved debug logging
   - Added cleanup for setTimeout

3. **src/main.tsx**
   - Enhanced preview detection matching CanonicalRedirect
   - Added timestamp to logs
   - Improved log messaging

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ Emergency unblanker forces visibility immediately
‚úÖ Console logs now appear with timestamps
‚úÖ Preview detection catches all Lovable domains
‚úÖ 100ms delay ensures React mounts before redirects
‚úÖ Cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Expected Behavior

### Preview Environment (*.lovableproject.com)
1. HTML loads immediately
2. Emergency unblanker forces root visibility
3. React bundle loads and executes
4. Console shows: "üöÄ UNBLANKER: Root visibility forced"
5. Console shows: "üöÄ TradeLine 24/7 main.tsx executing..."
6. Console shows: "‚úÖ Preview environment detected, no redirect needed"
7. App renders normally

### Production Apex (tradeline247ai.com)
1. HTML loads immediately
2. React mounts normally
3. After 100ms, redirect to www.tradeline247ai.com
4. Console shows redirect message

### Production WWW (www.tradeline247ai.com)
1. HTML loads immediately
2. React mounts normally
3. No redirect occurs
4. Console shows: "‚úÖ Already on canonical domain (www)"

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Should see "üöÄ UNBLANKER" message first
   - Should see "üöÄ TradeLine 24/7 main.tsx executing..." 
   - Should see CanonicalRedirect decision logs

2. **Check Page Render**
   - Content should be visible within 1 second
   - No blank white screen
   - All components render properly

3. **Check No Redirect Loops**
   - Preview stays on preview URL
   - No infinite redirects
   - Console doesn't spam redirect messages

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Add `?safe=1` to URL to trigger safe mode
2. This bypasses all custom logic and renders app directly

## Status: DEPLOYED ‚úÖ

All fixes applied and ready for testing.
